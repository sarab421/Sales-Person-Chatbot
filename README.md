# Sales-Person-Chatbot
This project uses Langchain to create a chatbot for car dealerships. It checks the real-time inventory and only suggests available cars. The chatbot then acts as a salesperson, providing detailed info and assisting customers with their purchase, ensuring a personalized and efficient experience.
